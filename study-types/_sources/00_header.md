# Study Types

The development of empirical guidelines for studies involving large language models (LLMs) in software engineering is crucial for ensuring the validity and reproducibility of results. However, these guidelines must be tailored for different study types as they may pose unique challenges. Therefore, understanding the classification of these studies is essential for developing appropriate guidelines.
We envision that a mature set of guidelines provides specific guidance for each of these study types, addressing their individual methodological idiosyncrasies.

As outlined on the [Motivation and Scope](/scope) page, we currently focus on large language models, that is, on natural language processing. In the future, we might extend our focus to multimodal foundation models.
Moreover, we require an active involvement of LLMs in data collection, processing, or analysis.
We consider LLMs supporting writing or LLMs supporting study design to be out-of-scope for our guidelines.
