# Study Types

The development of empirical guidelines for software engineering (SE) studies involving LLMs is crucial to ensuring the validity and reproducibility of results.
However, such guidelines must be tailored to different study types that each pose unique challenges.
Therefore, we developed a taxonomy of study types that we then use to contextualize the recommendations we provide.

Each study type section starts with a **description**, followed by **examples** from the SE research community and beyond as well as the **advantages** and **challenges** of using LLMs for the respective study type.
The remainder of this section is structured as follows:

1. [LLMs as Tools for Software Engineeering Researchers](#introduction-llms-as-tools-for-software-engineering-researchers)
    1. [LLMs as Annotators](#llms-as-annotators)
    2. [LLMs as Judges](#llms-as-judges)
    3. [LLMs for Synthesis](#llms-for-synthesis)
    4. [LLMs as Subjects](#llms-as-subjects)
2. [LLMs as Tools for Software Engineers](#introduction-llms-as-tools-for-software-engineers)
    1. [Studying LLM Usage in Software Engineering](#studying-llm-usage-in-software-engineering)
    2. [LLMs for new Software Engineering Tools](#llms-for-new-software-engineering-tools)
    3. [Benchmarking LLMs for Software Engineering Tasks](#benchmarking-llms-for-software-engineering-tasks)
3. [References](#references)
