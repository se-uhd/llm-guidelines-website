LLMs can serve as powerful tools to help researchers conduct empirical studies.
They can automate various tasks such as data collection, pre-processing, and analysis.
For example, LLMs can apply predefined coding guides to qualitative datasets (\annotators), assess the quality of software artifacts (\judges), generate summaries of research papers (\synthesis), or simulate human behavior in empirical studies (\subjects).
This can significantly reduce the time and effort required to conduct a study.
However, besides the many advantages that all these applications bring, they also come with challenges such as potential threats to validity and implications for the reproducibility of study results.
