LLM-based assistants have become a widely adopted tool for software engineers~\cite{stackoverflow2025survey}, supporting them in various tasks such as code generation and debugging.
Researchers have studied how software engineers use LLMs (\llmusage), developed new tools that integrate LLMs (\newtools), and benchmarked LLMs for software engineering tasks (\benchmarkingtasks).
%Like in the previous section, we outline the advantages that studying LLMs in these contexts brings, but also point to specific challenges.
