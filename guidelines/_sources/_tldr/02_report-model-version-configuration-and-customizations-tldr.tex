Researchers \must report in the \paper the exact LLM model or tool version, configuration, and experiment date. For fine-tuned models, they \must describe the fine-tuning goal, dataset, and procedure. Researchers \should include default parameters, explain model choices, compare base- and fine-tuned model using suitable metrics and benchmarks, and share fine-tuning data and weights (or justify why they cannot share them).
