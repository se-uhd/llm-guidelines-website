Researchers \must report study limitations, including non-determinism and generalizability constraints. The \paper~\must specify whether generalization across LLMs or across time was assessed, and discuss model and version drift. Authors \must describe measurement constructs and methods, disclose any data leakage risks, and avoid leaking evaluation data into LLM improvement pipelines. They \must provide model outputs, discuss sensitive data handling, ethics approvals, and justify LLM usage in light of its resource demands.
