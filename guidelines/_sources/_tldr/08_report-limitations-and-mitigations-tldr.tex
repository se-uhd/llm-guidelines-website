Researchers \must transparently report study limitations, including the impact of non-determinism and generalizability constraints. The \paper~\must specify whether generalization across LLMs or across time was assessed, and discuss model and version differences. Authors \must describe measurement constructs and methods, disclose any data leakage risks, and avoid leaking evaluation data into LLM improvement pipelines. They \must provide model outputs, discuss sensitive data handling, and justify LLM usage in light of its resource demands. Mitigation strategies such as replication packages, human validation, longitudinal re-runs, triangulation, and sensitivity analysis \should be employed and reported where applicable. Where full data sharing is not possible, a subset of the validation data \should be included to enable partial replication.
