Researchers \should include an open LLM as a baseline when using commercial models in empirical studies and report inter-model agreement. By open LLM, we mean a model that everyone with the required hardware can deploy and operate. Such models are usually ``open weight.'' A full replication package with step-by-step instructions \should be provided as part of the \supplementarymaterial.
