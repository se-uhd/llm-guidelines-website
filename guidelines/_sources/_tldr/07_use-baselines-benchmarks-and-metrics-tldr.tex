Researchers \must justify all benchmark and metric choices in the \paper and \should summarize benchmark structure, task types, and limitations. Where possible, traditional (non-LLM) baselines \should be used for comparison. Researchers \must explain why the selected metrics are suitable for the specific study. They \should report established metrics to make study results comparable, but can report additional metrics that they consider appropriate. Due to the inherent non-determinism of LLMs, experiments \should be repeated; the result distribution \should then be reported using descriptive statistics.
