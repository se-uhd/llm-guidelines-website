Researchers \must disclose any use of LLMs to support empirical studies in their \paper, specifying which LLM was used, how it was used, and where in the research process it was employed. They \should report the exact purpose, the tasks that were automated, and the expected benefits. When the LLM plays a central role, the declaration \should be prominent and detailed in the methodology section; for tangential uses, a brief statement in the methodology or acknowledgments suffices.
