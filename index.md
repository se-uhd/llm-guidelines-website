# LLM Guidelines for SE 
{: .fs-9 }

Evaluation Guidelines for Empirical Studies in Software Engineering involving LLMs.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

This website hosts **community guidelines** for empirical studies in software engineering involving LLMs.
Besides our [motivation and scope](/scope), we present a first taxonomy of [LLM study types](/study-types) and corresponding [guidelines](/guidelines).
These guidelines are meant as a starting point for further discussions in the community with the aim of developing a common understanding of how we should conduct and report empirical studies involving large language models (LLMs).

This project was initiated by a [position paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07668) as well as discussion during the [ISERN](https://isern.iese.de/) 2024 meeting and the 2nd [Copenhagen Symposium on Human-Centered Software Engineering AI](https://www.danielrusso.org/copenhagen-symposium-human-centered-ai-software-engineering/).
To contribute to the guidelines, you can open an issue or a pull request in [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/se-ubt/llm-guidelines).
