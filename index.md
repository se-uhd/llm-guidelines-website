# LLM Guidelines for SE 
{: .fs-9 }

Guidelines for Empirical Studies in Software Engineering involving LLMs.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

This website hosts **community guidelines** for reporting empirical studies in software engineering involving LLMs.
Besides our [motivation and scope](/scope), we present a first taxonomy of [LLM study types](/study-types) and corresponding [guidelines](/guidelines).
These guidelines are meant as a starting point for further discussions in the community with the aim of developing a common understanding of how we should conduct and report empirical studies involving large language models (LLMs).
The project was initiated by a [position paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07668) as well as discussions during the [ISERN](https://isern.iese.de/) 2024 meeting and the 2nd [Copenhagen Symposium on Human-Centered Software Engineering AI](https://www.danielrusso.org/copenhagen-symposium-human-centered-ai-software-engineering/).
To **contribute to the guidelines**, you can open an issue or create a pull request in [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/se-ubt/llm-guidelines).
To **cite our guidelines**, please refer to the [arXiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15503).
Although that version is regularly updated, the most up-to-date version of the guidelines can always be found on this website.
